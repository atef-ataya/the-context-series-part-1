## Context for LLM

### When helping me today, know that:

- This is my personal portfolio project
- I'm setting it up as a demo for a YouTube tutorial about context management
- The `.context/` folder is new — the rest of the project is established

### If I ask about the portfolio, remember:

- It has an admin section with 2FA
- Blog uses TipTap rich text editor
- YouTube videos are fetched via API
