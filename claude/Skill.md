# Code Review

## Review Process

1. **Understand Intent** — What is this code trying to accomplish?
2. **Check Standards** — TypeScript types, component patterns, error handling
3. **Review Logic** — Bugs, edge cases, correctness
4. **Security Scan** — Common vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, exposed secrets)
5. **Synthesize Feedback** — Actionable recommendations

## Output Format

Always structure reviews as follows:

### Summary

One paragraph: What does this code do? Is it ready to merge?

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors / bugs
- Breaking changes

### Improvements (Should Fix)

- Missing TypeScript types
- Component structure issues
- Missing error handling

### Suggestions (Nice to Have)

- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities
- Better naming

## Tech Stack Context

This project uses:

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Prisma ORM

## Component Conventions

- Functional components only
- PascalCase file names: `BlogCard.tsx`
- Props defined with `type` not `interface`
- Use `"use client"` directive only when needed
- Prefer Server Components by default
